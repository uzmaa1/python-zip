Create pandas dataframe or tuples from lists using zip
You can use the lists to create lists of tuples and create a dictionary from it. Then, this dictionary can be used to construct a dataframe. zip() function takes in all iterators and return an iterator (the objects and that can be used to produce single item at a time). This function can create pandas DataFrames by merging two lists. Suppose there are two lists of student data, first list holds the name of student and second list holds the marks of student.
